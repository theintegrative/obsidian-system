Good question. The purpose of the automation folder is to collect, log and organise information that will repeat itself. This is so that you can optimize the workflow of idea creation itself. It does depend on the plugins and inventiveness, how you use this part of the vault. 

You will see that the folder structure of this is top down but the way it will unfold is bothom up. This is improtant to note because that is why it is created to connect these interessting patterns.

- Everything needs to be lowercase and seperation done by _ or -. This ensures that I can easily use a bash script or linux command for manipulating the files in anyway if I want
